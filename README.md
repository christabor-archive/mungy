Mungy: a tool for data munging
=====

Very simple tool that converts tabular data and lists into clean json for use in data visualization... or anything else!

Note: This tool may be a better solution, but chances are you're probably better off using a parsing helper like pandas' html IO module. https://github.com/pydata/pandas.
